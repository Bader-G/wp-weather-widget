# wp-weather-widget
WordPress dashboard weather widget

To setup project, place the bader-g-weather-widget folder into the WordPress plugins directory then activate the plugin.

All requirements for the project have been completed including the ability to dynamically set a location.

Made as a WordPress plugin for easy installation. Widget was developed using an object orientent apprach for scalability. 

My thoughts on the test are that it was an engaging test about the use of APIs in a WordPress development environment. 

Test took around 3 hours to complete.
